Hello, everyone!

I am excited to share that I have successfully created a Spring Boot project.
This project required considerable time and effort to build, but the hard work has paid off.
I have successfully integrated Spring Boot with the Postman API and connected it to a MySQL database, which has provided me with valuable insights into how REST APIs interact with backend databases.

The dependencies required for this project include:

Spring Web,

Spring Data JPA,

MySQL Driver,

Lombok,

Spring Boot DevTools.

Additionally, the tools and environments I used to complete this project are:

Spring Workspace,

Postman,

MySQL Database.

This project has greatly enhanced my understanding of full-stack development, particularly in terms of API integration and database management.

If you appreciate my work, give me a thumbs up! üëç
